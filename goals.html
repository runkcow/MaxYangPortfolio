            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>November 2024 - I want to improve my ability to adapt to a different work culture or environment. I understand the social dynamics better so my responses are more fitting for each department. I will improve my social awareness by closely observing how people talk to each other instead of impulsively doing my work.</p>
            <p>November 2024 - I want to improve the professionalism and formality of my documents. I want to decrease wasteful technical details and replace it with substance that improves reader understanding without needing full context. I will read more journalist websites and observe the writings of my colleagues for reference.</p>
            <p>December 2024 - I want to improve my oral presentation and my improvisation skills. I want to quicken my presentations as I seem to lag on less important details and I want to smoothen my speeches by avoiding filler information.</p>
            <p>April 2025 - I want to improve my ability to read my professors and understand what they expect of me. I will present finished assignments and answers that better represent what the professors want to see. I will email my professor if I feel uncertain about how well my work fits the assessment and if I received a grade that I donâ€™t believe to be fitting.</p>
            <p>April 2025 - I want to improve the consistency of my personal projects. It seems that a lot of my personal projects end up unfinished due to bad time allocation and decreased interest over time.</p>
            <p>April 2025 - I want to improve my attention span as I struggle to stay focused on long winded presentations or uninteresting reads. It seems to strike me at every part of my life as I struggle to absorb entire sentences in conversations and have to ask for people to repeat themselves at times.</p>
