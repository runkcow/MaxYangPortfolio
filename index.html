            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Max Yang, a student studying Computer Science at York University. I grew up in a middle-class family, where I was taught to be respectful and considerate. Growing up, I received a small monthly allowance, it made me value my belongings and helped me realize to value the belongings of others as well. My limited resources had taught me to be resourceful and explore my options before making any expenditures. This shaped how I viewed the world, assessing opportunities for their practical applications and associated costs. Recently, I have become interested in computer hardware after building myself a custom computer. This added to my interests of scripting and automation.</p>
            <p>York University was a practical choice for me, largely because of its co-op program and the opportunities given by Lassonde School of Engineering. I have come to realize the valuable opportunities given by my professors at York University, it assisted both my personal and professional development. My degree in Computer Science aligns with my interests in innovation, problem-solving and automation.</p>
            <p>One of the more significant moments in my journey was upgrading my laptop before I started university. At that time, my knowledge on hardware was still limited and I was experiencing severe performance issues on the computer. By taking the risk, I gained invaluable hands-on experience and greatly boosted my confidence in technical problems. This experienced demonstrates my ability to tackle challenges and manage risks, reinforcing my passion for technology and problem-solving. It was a crucial step in my journey that helped shape my approach to challenges and problems in my studies and career.</p>
